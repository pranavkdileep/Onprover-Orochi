# Orochi OnProver Automation

Automate interactions with [onprover.orochi.network](https://onprover.orochi.network/) using Puppeteer and Node.js.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Obtain Your Access Token

Before running, you **must** obtain your personal `accessToken` from [onprover.orochi.network](https://onprover.orochi.network/).  
InspectElement -> Application -> Cookies -> `accessToken`.
Set this as an environment variable named `acess_token` (note the spelling).
